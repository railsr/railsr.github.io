This is a draft post that isn't ready for the wild. See how it doesn't show up in your list of posts, nor in your RSS feed? You can, however, [link](/posts/draft/) directly to it.

To make it go live, all you have to do is remove the `draft:true` line, and you're off to the races.

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
