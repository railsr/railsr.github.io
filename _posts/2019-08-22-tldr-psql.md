This is just a collection of tiny psql notes. Doesn't cover everything but good for reference.

|||
|-|-|
|`\d` | list of tables |
|`\d table_name` | describe table |
|`\du` | list roles |
|`\c db_name` | connect to database |
|`\i path to .sql file` | execute sql from a file |
|`\x`| expanded display for record details |
|`\h`, `\?`| help|
|`\df`| list of available functions |


```sql
INSERT INTO table_name(col_name1, col_name2) VALUES (value1, value2)

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE id = 1

DROP TABLE table_name
```

handling duplicate keys error with ON CONFLICT.
ON CONFLICT(field) - field should be a primary key or a unique constraint

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name(col_name1, col_name2)
VALUES (value1, value2)
ON CONFLICT (col_name1) DO NOTHING;
```

`NOTHING` can be replaced with `UPDATE SET email = EXCLUDED.email`, `last_name = EXCLUDED.last_name;` etc

In this case we can ignore the constraint and update it. "Override existing data if present, otherwise insert a new row"


```sql
UPDATE person SET name = 'Peter' WHERE name = 'Pete';
```

-

Get the first 10 rows. Just like limit 10
```sql
FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY
```

Returns the first not null value
```sql
SELECT COALESCE(NULL, NULL, 'some value')
```

If 2 values are the same, return 0/null
```sql
NULLIF (val1, val1)
```

Add unique constraint
```sql
ALTER TABLE person ADD CONSTRAINT unique_email UNIQUE (email);
```

CHECK allows to add a constraint based on some rule that you specify inside of CHECK
```sql
ALTER TABLE person ADD CONSTRAINT unique_email CHECK(email = 'something')
```

In this case the constraint name is defined by postgres(eg: person_email_key)
```sql
ALTER TABLE person ADD UNIQUE (email);
```


### Relations

BIGSERIAL is managed by postgres and increments itself. It can't be used for references(use BIGING instead).

```sql
create table person (
	id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
	car_id BIGINT REFERENCES car (id),
	UNIQUE(car_id)
);

create table car (
	id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
);
```

Updating foreign key

```sql
UPDATE person SET car_id = 1 WHERE id = 2;
```

### Joins
- __JOIN__ (both tables have foreign key constraint)
- __LEFT JOIN__ (if there's no value, empty cell will be displayed on the joined table)


```sql
SELECT * FROM person
LEFT JOIN car ON car.id = person.car_id
WHERE car.* IS NULL
```

`car.*` means check every single column

### Extensions
List of extensions
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions;
```

Example with uuid:
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
```

example of how to use functions `SELECT uuid_generate_v4();`

```sql
create table person (
	person_uid UUID NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
	car_uid UUID REFERENCES car(car_uid),
	UNIQUE(car_uid)
);

create table car (
	car_uid UUID NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
);

INSERT INTO person values(uuid_generate_v4());
```

With UUID setting foreign key is the same as with regular id:
```sql
UPDATE person SET car_uid = 'fe4123c3-...' WHERE person_uid = 'fe123v2-...';
```


Joining when the keys are the same

```sql
SELECT * FROM person
JOIN car USING(car_uid)
```


### Other
Export file to csv and save to the desktop
```terminal
\copy (SELECT * FROM car) TO '/Users/krq/Desktop/res.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```


If email is null "Email is not provided" message will be displayed
```sql
SELECT COALESCE(email, 'Email is not provided') FROM person;
```


```sql
SELECT COALESCE(SELECT 10 / NULLIF(0,0), 0);
```

### Dates

```sql
SELECT NOW();
SELECT NOW()::TIME;
SELECT NOW()::DATE;
SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '3 YEARS';
SELECT NOW()::DATE - INTERVAL '1 YEAR';


SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM NOW());
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM NOW());

AGE(NOW(), date_of_birth) as age;
```
