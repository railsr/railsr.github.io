## About:

I started learning C#/asp.net mvc after some practice with C/C++
Didn't like it much. Probably because of a lack of experience.

After switching from windows to macos I started learning ruby and later rails.
Since then, I have about 2 year of experience with ror.

Interested in javascript. Started learning angular2. Have plans to try java :)
